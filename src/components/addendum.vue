    <h3>What is Theory A?</h3>

    <div class="block">
      Theory A is that which is hidden between right and wrong. It the theory of
      unknowable truths and unfalsifiable falsehoods. It's not about You and it's not
      NOT about you, but the You and NOT You that you know to be true.
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      It is the line beween caring too much and caring too little.
      <br>It it that which is between doing more than you should and less than you can.
      <br>It is a way to surprise ourselves and so delight the world.
      <br>It is the light that exists not in spite of the darkness but because of the darkness.
      <br>It is faith that the immeasurable is not invisible.

      It is also a re-affirmation of the humanity within everyone and our equality despite differences
      in race, gender, culture, upbringing, work-ethic, intelligence, wealth or luck. It is the belief in the potential of
      technology to bring freedom and empowerment to everyone by reducing the existence
      of arbitrary barriers and the gatekeepers protecting their moats who force humans to apologize
      for being human.

      For it is not about who plays the game best but what the game creates and what
      the game inspires. It is the creation of life energy that opposes entropy, if only for a little while.

      <div>Possibility is expressed in the desires of the young but judged by the old.</div>
      <div>The old do not see that they are dying.</div>
      <div>The young do not see that they too will die.</div>
      <div>To know this is to be a fallible god.</div>
      <div>To feel this is to be a perfect human.</div>
      <div>It is confidence without arrogance.</div>
      <div>It is courage to let go.</div>

      Theory A is a cash-grab experiment revolving around the idea of false dualities
      and the pains of seeking "truth" in a world where you are often forced to take sides.
